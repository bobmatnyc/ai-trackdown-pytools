# Release Notes - v1.2.0

## AI Trackdown PyTools v1.2.0 - Enhanced Unified Commands and Relationship Management

**Release Date**: 2025-07-24  
**Status**: Production/Stable

We are excited to announce version 1.2.0 of AI Trackdown PyTools! This release brings significant improvements with unified ticket management commands, enhanced epic-issue-task relationship management, and improved configuration handling.

## 🎉 Highlights

### Major New Features

#### 1. Unified Ticket Management Commands
We've introduced a set of unified commands that work across all ticket types (epics, issues, tasks, PRs) with automatic type inference:

- **`aitrackdown show <ticket-id>`** - Display any ticket type
- **`aitrackdown close <ticket-id>`** - Close any ticket type  
- **`aitrackdown transition <ticket-id> <status>`** - Change ticket status
- **`aitrackdown archive <ticket-id>`** - Archive tickets to `archive/` subdirectories
- **`aitrackdown delete <ticket-id>`** - Delete tickets (with confirmation)

No more remembering different commands for different ticket types!

#### 2. Enhanced Relationship Management
Managing relationships between epics, issues, and tasks is now easier:

```bash
# Link an issue to an epic
aitrackdown epic link-issue EP-001 ISS-005

# Link a task to an issue  
aitrackdown issue link-task ISS-005 TSK-010

# Create a task already linked to an issue
aitrackdown create task "Fix bug" --issue ISS-005

# Unlink relationships
aitrackdown issue unlink-task ISS-005 TSK-010
```

#### 3. Dynamic Configuration Reloading
The configuration system now supports dynamic reloading without restarting:
- Automatic detection of configuration changes
- Cache management for optimal performance
- Proper handling of tasks directory configuration

### Key Improvements
- **Better Error Messages**: More helpful error messages guide you when something goes wrong
- **Archive Support**: All ticket types can now be archived to keep your active list clean
- **Improved Search**: Search now includes archived tickets
- **Consistent Operations**: Unified utility functions ensure consistent behavior across all commands
