  - Shows error: slice indices must be integers or have an __index__ method, not str

  - However, the update still completes successfully

  - Likely a formatting or display issue


  ## 2. Comment Functionality - Lookup Issues

  - Comment commands appear to have directory/file lookup problems

  - May need to update path resolution for comment storage

  - Not critical as comments are an enhancement feature


  ## 3. Status Project Command - NoneType Error

  - When running: ./venv/bin/aitrackdown status project

  - Shows error: ''NoneType'' object has no attribute ''get''

  - Likely missing project configuration or initialization


  ## Impact:

  - All core functionality works correctly

  - Files are created in correct locations

  - No data corruption or loss

  - These are minor UI/display issues


  ## Priority:

  Low - These don''t block any critical workflows'
