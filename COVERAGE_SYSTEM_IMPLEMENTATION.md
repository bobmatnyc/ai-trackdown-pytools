- `.coveragerc` - Detailed coverage.py configuration file
- `coverage-extra.css` - Custom styling for HTML reports

**Key Features:**
- Branch coverage enabled for comprehensive analysis
- 85% coverage threshold with fail-fast behavior
- Multiple output formats (HTML, XML, JSON, LCOV)
- Smart exclusion patterns for test files and build artifacts
- Relative file paths for better portability

### 2. Coverage Analysis Engine (`scripts/coverage_analysis.py`)
